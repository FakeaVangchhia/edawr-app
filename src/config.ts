 * Why the resolution above is caught rather than allowed to throw.

 * deliberate. What was wrong was *where* it happened: at module scope, during
 * the import of `config.ts`, which `api.ts` imports and the root layout imports in
 * turn. So the throw landed before React had rendered anything and before any
 * error boundary existed to catch it, and the carefully written message went to
 * a log nobody reads while the customer got a white screen and a crash to home.
 *
 * The message is the entire value of failing loudly, so it has to reach a
 * screen. `app/_layout.tsx` checks `configError` and renders it; `apiUrl()` throws for
 * anything that somehow calls it anyway.
 *
 * `API_URL` stays exported and is `''` when unresolved — `report-error.ts` reads
 * it directly, which is a string either way, and the app never gets that far in
 * the broken case.
